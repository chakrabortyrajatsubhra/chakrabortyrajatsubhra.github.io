## About

From mangas to comic books to detective novels these things keep me glued all day long. A foodie and a Batman fanatic, I spend most of my leisure time reading about human evolution and anthropology. I am a second-year Ph.D. student at University of North Carolina Charlotte under the guidance of [Dr.Depeng Xu](https://webpages.charlotte.edu/dxu7/) and [Dr.Cori Faklaris](https://corifaklaris.com) ,currently I am exploring how to mitigate biases in Text-To-Image Models and do research in the intersection of interpretibility,fairness and bias. Previously, I was doing research in the area of multimodal understanding of LVLMs and semi-supervised object detection. I did my undergraduate in Kolkata from Future Institute of Engineering and Management where my thesis was in the area of character recognition in Devanagari and Bengali script under the guidance of [Dr. Shibaprasad Sen](https://www.cmaterju.in/scholars/shibaprasad-sen). If you love playing FIFA and talking about research and comic books, do drop by in Woordward Hall 3rd Floor RM 312 ,UNC Charlotte, North Carolina.
