## About

From mangas to comic books to detective novels these things keep me glued all day long. A foodie and a Batman fanatic, I spend most of my leisure time reading about human evolution and anthropology. I am a first-year Ph.D. student at University of North Carolina Charlotte under the guidance of [Dr.Srijan Das](https://srijandas07.github.io) and currently I am exploring the use of semi-supervised learning in object detection and understanding long videos with VLMs. Previously, I was doing research in the use of Diffusion Models in Medical Images. I did my undergraduate in Kolkata from Future Institute of Engineering and Management where my thesis was in the area of character recognition in Devanagari and Bengali script under the guidance of [Dr. Shibaprasad Sen](https://www.cmaterju.in/scholars/shibaprasad-sen). If you love playing FIFA and talking about research and comic books, do drop by in [Charlotte Machine Learning Lab](https://charlotteml.github.io) in Woordward Hall ,UNC Charlotte, North Carolina.
