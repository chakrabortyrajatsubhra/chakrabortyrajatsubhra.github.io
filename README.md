### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a PhD Computer Science student at the University of Kentucky. I am also a Research Assistant at the [EduceLab](https://educelab.engr.uky.edu/directory) under the supervision of [Dr. Brent Seales](https://educelab.engr.uky.edu/w-brent-seales). I enjoy doing research in Computer Science, specifically in the field of Computer Vision, Computer Graphics and Machine Learning. I am interested in application of these techniques to Digital Humanities.
